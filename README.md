# Molecfit Pre-Post Visualization Tool

This repository contains a Python script designed to visualize spectroscopic data before and after applying Molecfit corrections. The tool is particularly useful for selecting wavelength ranges (`WAVE_INCLUDE` and `WAVE_EXCLUDE`) where telluric absorption occurs but is not excessively deep.

## Features

- **Pre- and Post-Molecfit Spectra Visualization**  
  Compare the raw (pre-Molecfit) and corrected (post-Molecfit) spectra in a single plot.
  
- **Interactive Range Selection**  
  Identify optimal wavelength ranges for telluric correction by closely examining absorption regions.

- **Data Location**  
  The input data file is the `TELLURIC_DATA.fits` file generated by Molecfit, typically located at:  
  `reflex_tmp_products/molecfit/SPECTROGRAPH/molecfit_calctrans_1/date/`

  - **Column 2**: Raw spectra (pre-Molecfit).  
  - **Column 7**: Corrected spectra (post-Molecfit).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. ### Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/molecfit-pre-post.git
   cd molecfit-pre-post
   
2. ### Install the required dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. ### Use the script for visualization:
Place the Molecfit output file (TELLURIC_DATA.fits) in the working directory.
Execute the script using the following command:
    python scripts/Pre_Post_Molecfit.py
   
4. ### The script will generate visualization plots of the raw (pre-Molecfit) and corrected (post-Molecfit) spectra. These plots will help you select appropriate wavelength ranges for further processing.
